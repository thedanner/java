iProject 2:

What's new since iP1?

- Scrolling has been implemented in the form of a character matrix which is
painted to the canvas, rather than the letters being directly painted.

-Implemented a CPU, Memory Management Unit, and Main Memory as hardware
simulation items.
-Created a PCB object, which isn't much used at the moment.
-Added the facility to load and run user programs, as in the description of
iProject2.
-Added a debug display, which show register values and the first couple words
in memory.

-ShellCommands now have aliases.
-Several other minor enhancements

Wanted to get done as well:
Single step; perhaps for next time.

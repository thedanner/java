mAd.OS
iProject 1:
Creative feature: enhanced log (as if to mimic an attached debugger).

Scrolling not implemented intentionally.  Learning HTML Canvas
for something as unimportant (to the objectives of the class)
as scrolling is beyond the scope of an operating systems course.

Same for graphical status bar; it's implemened outside the canvas
for this reason.

Robodog has been lured into a factory under the promise of bacon.  But, it's not just any bacon -- it's ENERGY BACON!!  By using his love for bacon against him, the Laser Penguins were able to trap our hero in the depths of the bacon factory.  Robodog must collect the ENERGY BACON to harness its awesome power and open the exit door found in each area of the factory. Trying to prevent his escape are the evil Laser Penguins and KFCs (no relation to the Colonel).  Robodog must make it through each level successfully and defeat the factory's boss -- the Hydra Chicken -- before he can make his escape!

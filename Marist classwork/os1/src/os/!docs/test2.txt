CODE IS DATA....    DATA IS CODE....
This program loads data from the code
records and code from the data records.
Then it branches to the code in upper
memory which overwrites the code in
lower memory with data. As you can see.

Hello World!                            
"Some say the world will end in fire,   
Some say in ice.                        
From what I've tasted of desire         
I hold with those who favor fire.       
But if it had to perish twice,          
I think I know enough of hate           
To say that for destruction ice         
Is also great                           
And would suffice." - Robert Frost      
fireice Goodbye World!                  
The world ends in fire.                 
The world ends in ice.
